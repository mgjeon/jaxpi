# Allen-Cahn equation

## Problem Setup

The partial differential equation is defined as 

$$\begin{aligned}
    & u_t - 0.0001 u_{xx} + 5 u^3 - 5 u  = 0,\quad t \in [0, 1],\ x\in[-1, 1],\\
    &u(0, x) = x^2 \cos(\pi x),\\
    &u(t, -1) = u(t, 1),\\
    &u_x(t, -1) = u_x(t, 1).
\end{aligned}$$

## Results

### Ablation study
We conducted an ablation study on **Algorithm 1**, maintaining identical hyperparameters across all tests. The results are displayed in the table below. You can find the specific configuration of the hyperparameters in the `configs` directory.

### State of the Art

We present our state-of-the-art results. These are achieved by conducting a comprehensive hyperparameter sweep to find the optimal combination of network architecture, loss weighting scheme, and optimizer configuration. 

To replicate these results, use the following command:

```
python main.py --config ./configs/sota.py 
```

After training, edit the following line in the configuration file to get the final predicted error and visualization.

```
config.mode = "eval"
```

Our methods have managed to reduce the best relative $L^2$ error to
$9.55 \times 10^{-5}$. The figure below illustrates the exact solution, our model's prediction, and the absolute error.
